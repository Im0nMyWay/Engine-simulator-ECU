TODO :

- See discord for chat with LamborghiniEnjoyer (talked about the relation between max advance and redline)
- Up to 1k rpm, set advance to +5° to avoid kickbacks when starting on the default profile
- Add a 'Easy start' button to set ignition timing to +5° from 0 to 1k rpm : .add_sample(0000 * units.rpm, 5 * units.deg
- Put starter settings back in the ECU in the ignition tab (and rename the tab 'ignition advance and starter') ?
- Dark / Light / Default themes
- Unit detection system for starter torque and others
- VTEC control section
- fix starter speed not being detected with the '-'
